# Loops and Conditions Program

## Overview
This Python program demonstrates the use of **loops** (such as `for` and `while`) and **conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to solve various logical problems. It's designed to help beginners understand the fundamentals of control flow in Python.

## Features
- Implements common use cases for **loops**:
  - Iterating over a range of numbers.
  - Nested loops for complex patterns.
  - Breaking out of loops using `break` and `continue`.
- Uses **conditional statements** for decision-making:
  - Checking multiple conditions with `if-elif-else`.
  - Logical operators like `and`, `or`, `not`.
- Examples of combining loops and conditions to solve problems:
  - Finding prime numbers.
  - Calculating factorials.
  - Printing patterns.
  - Validating user input.
